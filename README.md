# Real-time detection of muscle fatigue onset

For detection and prevention of the risk factors behind musculoskeletal disorders, accurate assessment of neuromuscular fatigue is essential. As amplitude and frequency of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for a particular muscle are good indicators of the state of the muscle, they can be used for the evaluation of muscle fatigue. For example, during a dynamic exertion, a simultaneous increase in the amplitude and decrease in the median frequency of sEMG signal for a muscle indicate that the muscle is in fatigued state whereas a simultaneous decrease in the amplitude and increase in the median frequency indicate that the muscle is in recovery state. Deep learning techniques are a suitable option for detecting the state of a muscle as they employ neural networks to learn the patterns in the input data (i.e., sEMG data) that lead to that particular muscle state. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a modular neural network for the real-time detection of muscle fatigue from sEMG data during dynamic exertions.
